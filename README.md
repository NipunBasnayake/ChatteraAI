# **ChatterAI**

## **Overview**
ChatterAI is an interactive web-based chat application that allows users to engage in real-time conversations with an AI chatbot. The chatbot utilizes the Gemini AI model to generate contextually relevant responses, making it a powerful tool for seamless communication. The app features a modern user interface with an interactive message system, real-time AI responses, and a smooth experience for users.

## **Technologies Used**

## **How It Works**
1. **User Message**: The user types a message and hits Enter or clicks the send button.
2. **AI Processing**: The user's message is sent to the AI, and the response is fetched asynchronously.
3. **Display Conversation**: Both user and AI messages are displayed in a chat-like format. A typing indicator is shown while the AI is processing the response.
4. **Real-time Interaction**: The app provides a real-time chat experience without page reloads.

## **Code Breakdown**
### **Message Handling**
The chat interface dynamically adds messages as they are sent or received:
- **send()**: Sends the user's message and waits for an AI response.
- **addMessage()**: Adds either user or AI messages to the chat window, with different styles and avatars.
- **addTypingIndicator()**: Displays a "typing..." indicator while the AI is formulating a response.
- **removeTypingIndicator()**: Removes the typing indicator once the AI responds.

### **AI Response**
The app integrates with the Gemini AI API:
- The userâ€™s message is sent to the API endpoint.
- The AI processes the message and returns a generated response, which is then displayed to the user.

### **Time Handling**
Each message includes a timestamp to show the time it was sent. The `getTime()` function formats the time in a 12-hour AM/PM format.

## **Usage**
1. **Enter Message**: Type your message into the input box at the bottom of the chat window.
2. **Send Message**: Press the **Enter** key or click the **Send** button to send your message.
3. **View Response**: The AI's response will appear after a brief typing indicator.
4. **Interaction**: Continue the conversation with the AI by typing additional messages.
